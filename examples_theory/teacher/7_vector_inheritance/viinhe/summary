Base.h
Base.cc            :  a very simple class tracing which derived
                      class initializes it
IntermediateA.h
IntermediateA.cc
IntermediateB.h
IntermediateB.cc   :  two classes virtually derived from Base
Derived.h
Derived.cc         :  a class derived from IntermediateA and IntermediateB

multipleInheritance.cc : create the classes, call the function and 
                         print the pointers

to compile:
c++ -Wall -o multipleInheritance multipleInheritance.cc \
